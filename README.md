## Dotfiles!

Clone this into `~/dotfiles` or wherever you want. See if I care.

Then, just symlink the config files to the proper places.

For the vim config, you'll need [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), and for the zsh config you'll need [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
